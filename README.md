### About me

I'm Filipe and I've been working as a mobile developer for almost 6 years, and Iâ€™m passionate about the mobile environment, always delivering a solution focusing on the best code and following the UX's proposals. I also love music and the financial market. I believe that these areas of knowledge combined with good ideas and engagement can transform the world.

Currently Iâ€™m a mobile specialist at Grupo BoticÃ¡rio working with technologies such as React Native, Typescript, Swift, Kotlin, Redux, Redux-Thunk and NodeJS. I'm also one of the founders of BlueHolder, a company that helps investors keep track of their investments :)
