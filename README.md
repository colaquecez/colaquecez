### About me

I've been working as a mobile developer for almost seven years, building apps from scratch as well as maintaining and adding new features to larger apps. Iâ€™m passionate about the mobile environment, particularly around delivering great UX powered by high-quality source code. 

Currently, Iâ€™m a mobile specialist at Grupo BoticÃ¡rio, working with technologies such as React Native and Swift.
